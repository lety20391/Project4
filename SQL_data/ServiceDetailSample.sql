('Pet Grooming','Grooming is an important part of your pets care. All pets benefit from regular grooming, whether it is a short haired breed or one with a long or fluffy coat, regular grooming helps to ensure your pet is healthy and comfortable.

Keeping your pet�s coat clean by removing dirt and dead hair helps encourage new hair growth and reduces the amount of hair deposited on household furniture. Grooming regularly helps lower the chance of various health problems, such as parasite infestation, thrush, scratches, and other skin problems. Grooming also helps to stimulate new coat growth and prevents the formation of knots and tangles which may lead to skin irritation. Habitual grooming allows monitoring of the pet�s health by checking for cuts, heat, swelling, lameness, or changes in temperament, all of which could be indicative of illness forging of a closer bond between pet and owner. ','Making dogs & cats look great is our passion!',1),
('Vaccination Supply','Pet vaccines exist to prevent your pet from falling ill. They provide immunity from a range of infectious diseases that can affect both humans and animals.

In order to be effective, vaccines need to contain an agent similar to the microorganism that causes the disease. Once injected, this agent stimulates the body�s immune system, allowing the body to recognise it as a threat. The immune system will then attack the foreign agent and remember it so that in the future, should the body encounter the same disease, the immune system will be prepared to fight it off.

It is essential to know that vaccines work better in a healthy and relaxed animal. It usually takes around seven days for the body to respond and develop immunity. Therefore, giving a vaccine to your pet while it is already sick will be less effective. Vaccines do not work as a cure for diseases, but rather as a prevention.','Keeping your pet�s vaccinations up-to-date is crucial for a healthy lifestyle and proper pet development.',1),
